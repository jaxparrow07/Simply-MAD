# Simply-MAD
To find the Mean Average Deviation of a data set

```
I ain't no professional math guy. This is for 8th grade and now I'm finally able to understand this in 11th grade. TEHC
```
Don't be fooled by the funny description lol . I've worked on several serious projects too. This one was made for some experiment stuff and I wanted to know if I could implement this on python in a so simpler and easier way. I know this code can be improved in differnt ways. *exhales heavily*

## Exectution?
You can pass the data list as an comma seperated single list like **"1,2,3,4,5"** or either multiple args
```bash
python3 main.py '5,11,2,7,16'
``` 
```bash
python3 main.py 5 11 2 7 16
```
The program will take care of this job.. Don't worry. You can submit your Maths Home Work tomorrow.

**Output**
```
Data set = { 5, 11, 2, 7, 16 }
Mean : 8.2
Population : 5

The Mean Average Deviation is 4.2
